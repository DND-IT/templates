# Templates

The idea is that we treat templates as composable components to create our piece of art (an application). As in a pizza, you must have a mandatory, base component, the dough (wheat, gluten-free, sourdough, ...), and you can have multiple toppings (pesto, ham, salami, ...).

So as for an application you can pick your favourite [base](./bases/), and then add any topping you like.

These are the rules:

1. Only 1 base must be used.
1. 0 to infinite toppings can be added (afterwards).

That's how you identify if your template is a `base` or a `topping`.

Define variables that each Jinja template expects
