# Templates

Holds templates that can be customized through your favourite template engine (e.g. [Jinja](https://palletsprojects.com/projects/jinja/)). 

For an application you can pick your favourite [base](./bases/), and then add any addons you like.

These are the rules:

1. Only 1 base must be used.
1. 0 to infinite addons can be added (afterwards).

That's how you identify if your template is a `base` or an `addon`.

## TODO

Define variables that each Jinja template expects
